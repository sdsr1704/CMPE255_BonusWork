# Selected Options:

  1. Using the PyTorch Library's ResNet50 model for image identification
  2. Comparison of CUDA and CPU inferences 
  3. Serving with REST APIs and Flask deployments

# Steps that are Followed:

  1. Load a pre-trained neural network.
  2. Load an example with image prediction.
  3. Transform example image through pre-processing.
  4. Setting a batch size to example image
  5. Making prediction and getting probability for each class.
  6. Getting the names of all available ImageNet classes
  7. Extracting top 5 probabilities and mapping them to appropriate class name
  8. Define a speed test benchmark function & adjust it
  9. Find out CPU model speed benchmarks
 10. Find out CUDA model speed benchmarks
 11. Displaying comparison of inference improvements
